"Ugh. (Cut to a close up of Zuko with a disgusted look on his face) My Mother used to take us to see them. They butchered ""Love Amongst The Dragons"" every year.","(Cut to a close up side shot of Katara as she turns back to her brother) Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?","(He grins widely. Fade to a side view shot of the theatre at night. Cut to the curtains on the stage. Camera zooms out to show the Gaang walking into a private viewing box on the second floor facing the stage. Toph and Katara take their seats. Zuko walks in the opposite direction wearing a hooded cloak and sits beside Katara as Aang confidently tries to sit next to her. He is wearing a hat similar to Dock's in The Painted Lady to cover his bald, tattooed head. Aang stands up rubs his neck.)

Aang: Hey, uh... I wanted to sit (points at Zuko's spot) there. (he clenches his hands together)","Come on, a day at the theatre? (Unrolls the scroll towards his sister) This is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense I've been missing."
I was (Katara looks at the commotion and looks back to the stage) just... I wanted to... (sits next to Zuko) Okay.,(Cut to an undershot of the viewing box as Sokka and Suki sit in the row behind the 4 of them) Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section? My feet (the lights in the theatre dim down) can't see a thing from up here.,"(Cut to the stage as the curtain is drawn up to reveal a prop of a canoe surrounded by moving set decorations of water. The backdrop is a crude painting of icebergs. The Katara and Sokka actors are rowing the canoe with their oars. Cut to Katara who is excited. A hand touches her shoulder and she looks up, smiling at her brother and the camera zooms out as Sokka points to her and back to himself rapidly. He makes sounds of astonishment. Cut to Katara's actress who is much more developed and bigger sized than the real Katara and her clothes are a little revealing. She has too much blusher on her cheeks.)

Actress Katara: (sighs) Sokka, my only brother. We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas and yet never do we find anything fulfilling.
Actor Sokka: (Camera pans to the right to show Sokka's actor who is buck-toothed and thinner than the actual Sokka. His ""wolf-tail"" is an overly large ponytail bun.) All I want is a full feeling in my stomach, I'm starving!","Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening."
(She kneels down and places an arm around actor Sokka's shoulder and points to the ceiling above the audience) But wait. (Cut back to Aang who is visibly unamused and is slumped against the railing) Is that a platter of meaty dumplings?,(off screen) Ooo. (Cut back to the 3 actors as actor Sokka looks around) Where? Where?,"(Cut back to the Gaang's viewing box as the audience laughs off screen.)
Aang: (irritated) I don't do that. That's not what I'm like! And... I'm not a woman!
Toph: (laughs out loud as the rest turn to look at her) Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes.",(giggles uncontrollably) Did I mention (crosses her legs) that I'm an incurable prankster?
How do you know?,Because I once had a long conversation with the guy and all he would talk about was you. (Zuko lowers his hood and smiles),"Toph: Yeah, and it was kind of annoying.
Zuko: Oh, sorry.
Toph: But it was also very sweet. (Cut to an area above Toph's head as the camera slowly zooms in on a smiling and happy Zuko) All your Uncle wanted was for you to find your own path and see the light. Now you're here with us. ( Cut back to a frontal shot of them again) He'd be proud. (Toph proceeds to give him a punch on the shoulder)
Zuko: Ow. (rubs his arm) What was that for?",Really?
"(Cut to actor Sokka's point of view as Sokka smiles sweetly) Actually, I think I can help you. (points to actor Sokka) I'm a big Sokka fan but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be. (Cut to a side view shot of the scene.)","Oh no... (brings his hand to his head) another fan (turns and walks away) with ideas. (Sokka swiftly steps in front of him, blocking his path)","(Cut to a front shot of actor Sokka as Suki smacks her forehead behind him.)

Actor Sokka: (He laughs and Suki is surprised) That's actually pretty good. (Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka who smiles and offers the cue cards. Actor Sokka's hands come into screen and take the tiny slips of paper.) Let me see those. (Cut to an area behind Sokka looking at the 3 of them) Haha. Rocky relationship. Not bad.","(He places both arms out in front of him) Just hear me out. Here's something (He rummages through his belt and pulls up several cue cards) I think the real Sokka would say. (He shuffles through the cards and picks one card out from the pile and clears his throat) ""What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?"" (He smiles and thrusts his arms out in a 'Ta-Dah' motion) ""A cabbage patch."""
(Cut to a close up back view of the two as Katara turns her body towards Aang) I didn't say that. An actor (She gestures her arms towards the theatre) said that. (She places her right hand against her left elbow),"But it's true, isn't it? (Cut to a close up of a depressed Aang) We kissed at the invasion and I thought we were going to be together but we're not.","Aang: Why don't you know?
Katara: (seriously) Because we're in the middle of a war and (folds her arms and looks towards the theatre) we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time.
Aang: (Cut to a close up of an impatient Aang) Well, when is the right time?
Katara: (Cut to a close up of Katara who is deep in thought) Aang, I'm sorry but right now, (she tugs at her hair and closes her eyes) I'm just a little confused.","(Cut to an area above Aang's head as an unsure Katara turns back to the ocean) Aang, (shakes her head) I don't know."
"(The spotlight shines on actor Ozai) So, (Actress Aang turns towards him) you have mastered all 4 elements","(points her staff towards actor Ozai) Yeah and now, (points her free hand down) you're going down.","(Cut to a frontal shot of actor Ozai as he whips his red streamers out. Cut to a view of the stage as he throws it towards actress Aang and she jumps away. The streamers hit the floor in a puff of smoke. Cut to a close up of actress Aang as a white-blue flag pop up from both ends of her staff and she twirls the staff in arcs around her body. Cut to actor Ozai who is twirling the streamers around his body in arcs as well. He throws the streamers out but actress Aang flies over him, twirling her staff along the way.

Cut to a close up of actress Aang's back as she lands and she turns towards actor Ozai. Cut to full view of the scene as both actors twirl their prop weapons and walk towards each other. Actor Ozai throws his streamer out while actress Aang ducks and attempts to swipe her staff as actor Ozai's legs. She jumps away from him and lands in a stance. Cut to actor Ozai who begins to shoot streamers from his sleeves. Cut to a side view of actress Aang and the rope pulls her up over actor Ozai as he continues to shoot more streamers but misses.","(Cut to a close up of a lethal looking actor Ozai) No, it is you who are going down. (Cut to an area behind actress Aang's legs looking at actor Ozai as he stands up) You see, you are too late. (Actress Aang acts shocked) The comet is already here and (Cut to a frightened Aang as he widens his eyes) I'm unstoppable."

Child of the Most High King,Rev. James Cleveland,"1 ContributorActes and Monuments (Foxe’s Book of Martyrs) Chapter 16 LyricsPersecutions in England During the Reign of Queen MaryThe premature death of that celebrated young monarch, Edward VI, occasioned the most extraordinary and wonderful occurrences, which had ever existed from the times of our blessed Lord and Savior's incarnation in human shape. This melancholy event became speedily a subject of general regret. The succession to the British throne was soon made a matter of contention; and the scenes which ensued were a demonstration of the serious affliction in which the kingdom was involved. As his loss to the nation was more and more unfolded, the remembrance of his government was more and more the basis of grateful recollection. The very awful prospect, which was soon presented to the friends of Edward's administration, under the direction of his counsellors and servants, was a contemplation which the reflecting mind was compelled to regard with most alarming apprehensions. The rapid approaches which were made towards a total reversion of the proceedings of the young king's reign, denoted the advances which were thereby represented to an entire resolution in the management of public affairs both in Church and state.

Alarmed for the condition in which the kingdom was likely to be involved by the king's death, an endeavor to prevent the consequences, which were but too plainly foreseen, was productive of the most serious and fatal effects. The king, in his long and lingering affliction, was induced to make a will, by which he bequeathed the English crown to Lady Jane, the daughter of the duke of Suffolk, who had been married to Lord Guilford, the son of the duke of Northumberland, and was the granddaughter of the second sister of King Henry, by Charles, duke of Suffolk. By this will, the succession of Mary and Elizabeth, his two sisters, was entirely superseded, from an apprehension of the returning system of popery; and the king's council, with the chief of the nobility, the lord-mayor of the city of London, and almost all the judges and the principal lawyers of the realm, subscribed their names to this regulation, as a sanction to the measure. Lord Chief Justice Hale, though a true Protestant and an upright judge, alone declined to unite his name in favor of the Lady Jane, because he had already signified his opinion that Mary was entitled to assume the reins of government. Others objected to Mary's being placed on the throne, on account of their fears that she might marry a foreigner, and thereby bring the crown into considerable danger. Her partiality to popery also left little doubt on the minds of any, that she would be induced to revive the dormant interests of the pope, and change the religion which had been used both in the days of her father, King Henry, and in those of her brother Edward: for in all his time she had manifested the greatest stubbornness and inflexibility of temper, as must be obvious from her letter to the lords of the council, whereby she put in her claim to the crown, on her brother's decease.",0
That Special Place,Daryl Coley,"2 ContributorsChapter 19: Surprises LyricsHelen Keller had said in 1911: ""We vote? What does that mean?"" And Emma Goldman around the same time: ""Our modern fetish is universal suffrage."" After 1920, women were voting, as men did, and their subordinate condition had hardly changed.

Right after women got the vote, the measure of their social progress can he seen in an advice column written by Dorothy Dix that appeared in newspapers all over the country. The woman should not merely be a domestic drudge, she said:",0

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

She could have caught you with one sucia, she could have caught you with two, but because you’re a totally batshit cuero who never empties his e-mail trash can, she caught you with fifty! Sure, over a six-year period, but still. Fifty fucking girls? God damn! Maybe if you’d been engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita you could have survived it—but you’re not engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita. Your girl is a bad-ass salcedense who doesn’t believe in open anything; in fact, the one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was cheating. I’ll put a machete in you, she promised. And, of course, you swore you wouldn’t do it. You swore you wouldn’t. You swore you wouldn’t.",1

How are we going to do that?,I’m not sure.,"STRAND: Perhaps, unconsciously maybe.
ALEX: So… what’s next?
STRAND: Have a break. And then, this pile here.
ALEX: (sighs) That’s… that’s a lot of tapes.",This is why you agreed to let me interview you in the first place?
Maybe ‘56 or ‘57… Here.,"Oh, is that-?","STRAND: If I’m not mistaken, he photographed it again a few years later.
ALEX: What does it mean?
STRAND: I don’t know.
ALEX: Do you think your father was looking into the Order of the Cenophus?","Yes.And there it was, leaning against a moonlight Sicilian sky, the monolith.It was tall and thin and leaned like a creature swooping down just slightly. There was something carved into the top of the immense stone slab, something very familiar - it was a line above two small circles, it was the sign of the Order of the Cenophus, it was the upside-down face.ALEX"
Thomas Warren?,"Yes.Nic called and asked for a meeting with Thomas Warren. In the meantime, back to Strand and I going through his black tapes.ALEX","STRAND: I don’t know.In the middle of the circle, there is what looks like a… a figure, a dark silhouette, tall, suddenly appearing as if materialising right before our eyes.ALEX: What happened? What happened to them?
STRAND: That is the question.All six people collapsed on the ground, some on their faces, some on their backs. The figure in the centre, gone. Everything came to a complete and sudden stop.ALEX: That was the shadow-y figure we saw in the Torres birthday party and wedding. You didn’t think this was important enough to show me earlier?
STRAND: It’s not the same figure. Look. If you rewind it… here. Look more carefully at it.We were looking at the shadowy figure appearing in the centre of the circle again. It was moving, translucent, like a dark glass vase vibrating in air.STRAND: What’s missing?
ALEX: Uh… arms?","I don’t know where this is. My notes say the package arrived from Rome, no specific return address, but that chanting sounds like Latin.Watching this black tape I feel like I’ve seen this before. We’re looking at a group of six people in dark robes. I can’t see their faces, I think they’re barefoot. There’s hardly any light, except for a few lanterns outside of their circle. It looks like they’re in a cave or tunnel but it’s hard to tell. The strange thing is the angle at which this is being taped. It’s as if there’s a security camera above the group, as if attached to the ceiling of the cave or tunnel. The chanting gets louder… There are what appear to be intermittent streams of light passing through the group. The six people start making strange movements, as if dancing or twitching in place, their arms stuck to their sides, feet together.ALEX"
It’s just a tall dark... obelisk? What is it?,"Whatever it is, it’s not human. Could be a form of refracted light onto the camera.","STRAND: No, at least not technically. If you look here at the moment they collapse, you’ll notice that the lens flare off this one lamp here in the corner. It falls over at the exact moment this person falls. There’s no sign of editing or cut footage. The shadows in the room are all perfectly natural. This video hasn’t been manipulated.
ALEX: Mm… do you think they fainted?
STRAND: I think they’re dead. At least two of them.
ALEX: Why do you say that?",You think it’s a hoax?
I only see his hair covering his face…,You find it strange that a person on his back would have his face entirely covered by his hair? Wouldn’t it fall to the side?,"STRAND: Look at this one, on his front, what does that look like? That bump under the back of the hood.
ALEX: Is that… maybe the shape of a nose?
STRAND: Perhaps…
ALEX: Are they… were their heads… oh my god. Someone twisted their heads around, a hundred-and-eighty degrees?",What are you getting at?
Or a seizure?,"My first thoughts exactly, but that would require that they be half conscious or fully unconscious during whatever rite they were performing. And also it would take a considerable degree of force.","STRAND: Rarely, they usually include their names. Everybody wants the prize. About that-
ALEX: No need to explain.
STRAND: I have the money, it’s not liquid. It’s tied up in-
ALEX: No, I get it, I get it.",God… do you often get anonymous video tapes sent to your institute?
So… this seems to fit in with what we’re looking for. A cult that summons demons or something. In Rome.,"Not necessarily. The package was sent from Rome, it doesn’t mean that this was filmed there. It might not even be Italy.","STRAND: It’s impossible to say. It’s not like their denomination shows up in a census.
ALEX: Right.
STRAND: Any word on Percival Black?
ALEX: Nope, nothing.","Well, do you know how many cults or occult groups exist in Europe? Maybe we can cross-reference."
"Yeah, looks like it.We were at a dead end. With no way to reach Percival Black since he took his supposed vow of silence, there was no way to know for certain what he’d been up to or if he’s a player in this conspiracy, or whatever this is. This was one of those mysteries in which it’s impossible to tell where it begins because at any moment, Dr. Strand could posit a possible scenario that had nothing at all to do with the supernatural but just bad people doing bad things... or people like Simon Reese.NIC",Argentina?,"ALEX: What about his family? There’s that one aunt who…
NIC: Still not willing to speak with us.
ALEX: Right.
NIC: Simon’ll call.","Yeah, no, there’s nothing."
"Yeah.That’s my producer, Nic, he’d been searching online for any mention of Simon Reese which was proving to be difficult and frustrating.ALEX",Yeah no.,"NIC: (sarcastically) Hah.
ALEX: Sorry, couldn’t help it.
NIC: Anything new with Strand?
ALEX: Nothing really, just one inexplicable oddity after another.",Did you try typing ‘bilocating’ into the OkCupid search bar?
He’s definitely an inexplicable oddity.,I think he’s warming up a little. Isn’t he?,"NIC: That many?
ALEX: Well it’s gonna take forever if we’re gonna be thorough about this.
NIC: Anything that relates to the Cenophus or the Unsound?
ALEX: Or Percival Black or the Urraca Mesa or Thomas Warren or Glushka or the caves at Bath or Colville or any of the dozens of unrelated mysteries we’re trying to connect?","We’ve spent... what?... several hundred hours researching items related to a handful of black tapes and all this time, there were dozens of them in that back room. Just waiting."
I don’t know what the think.,Are you not sleeping?,"NIC: Yeah?
ALEX: They’re manageable.And in walked our intrepid intern, to save me from admitting to Nic that my night terrors weren’t quite as manageable as I was letting on. Nic, when you hear this as you’re mixing it, sorry.NIC: So what’s up?
INTERN: A volcano rumbled in Europe, aside from that, no signs of the apocalypse. Maybe Simon was right, maybe it’s more like a kind of personal apocalypse.
NIC: Right.",I just… (sighs) I need a dog. That’s what I need.
"Thanks, I’m good.",Alex?,"INTERN: Michelangelo was Italian… Ninja Turtle… Italian ninja… ugh, never mind.
(laughing)
INTERN: Uh what are you guys doing now?
ALEX: One guess…",Unless you know any Italian ninjas gifted at neck-breaking without being seen… I’m good.
"Good guess. Okay, there are five black tapes on this memory stick. The last one is the one I’m talking about. In Rome.",We should probably start marking these things on a map.,"ALEX: Well, Strand’s not sure but it was sent from Rome.
INTERN: Uh that’s a weird coincidence, I was just reading about an ancient cult in Rome last week. I sent you guys the article.
NIC: Well in our defense, you do send a lot of articles.

NIC: Well I took a look at the images from this tape. It’s shot in something close to 1080p.","I don’t think we’re looking for a cave… Take a look.Nic pulled up a still frame from the black tape we’d looked at earlier, from the ceremony.NIC"
"Now, yes. But look at the date. It’s from 2001. Most of us didn’t have security cameras that could shoot that resolution back then. Whoever made this tape had access to some really expensive equipment.",And a reason for needing that high resolution.,"THOMAS: Hello, Alex.

Network flow data is collected by IS&T as part of routine network management, and the logs are retained. These logs show which IP addresses communicated with which other IP addresses; when the communication took place; how many bytes were transmitted; how many data packets were transmitted; and the network ports used. The logs do not contain the substance of the communications transmitted between IP addresses.
MIT IS&T’s policy is to retain network flow data for as long as its storage capacity allows, up to a maximum of 30 days. In the case of the request by the special agent made on January 4, 2011, network flow data going back only to December 14, 2010, was available, and it was this data that was provided by MIT to the Secret Service on January 4, 2011.

2 This description is for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which is what the MIT network used in 2010 and uses today.","Devices located on the Internet are allocated IP addresses, which are in the form of a sequence of four separate numbers (each ranging from 0 to 255) separated by dots, i.e., 12.234.056.11, or generally, www.xxx.yyy.zzz.2 These numbers form a hierarchy, similar to a residential address being described by state, city, street name, and street number. For IP addresses, the highest level in the hierarchy, i.e., the state, is identified by a number that is referred to as the “Class A.” This is the first of the four numbers in the sequence. As one gets closer to the location of the actual device, one moves lower in the hierarchy, to the second number (Class B), then to the third (Class C), and finally to the device itself (the last number). Since the numbers used to denote the higher levels in the hierarchy can be viewed as groups of addresses located on networks and subnetworks, the classes are themselves referred to as networks, e.g., the Class A network, the Class B network, and the Class C network."

GAO: Perhaps. Yet you are not the man who came to me with a dream for this city. He was of a singular mind. Yours now is pulled in two directions by longings of the heart.
FISK: Is that why we're here? To discuss my private affairs?
GAO: No. We are here to discuss your fate. I speak your tongue now. So there is no mistaking my words. There is conflict within you.",I only sought to pose a question. How long before your ambition turns to me?

Your name is Ben Urich and you are a reporter. It's not a job. It's who you are.,"I don't know. This was 20 years ago, maybe. I was more fearless then. Don't see much of that guy now.","BEN: You keep sweet-talking I'm gonna climb in there with you.
They kiss.
BEN: Doris? Baby?
DORIS:Hello, gorgeous.","When we first met, you weren't fearless. You were reckless pushy. You were all about making a big splash, turning heads... You certainly turned mine. But that's not who you were always supposed to be. Experience made you more careful, wise. I don't know, Ben Urich, I think your best work is still ahead."
Ben?,I'll be right back. [gets up] Is this about the extension?,"They talk near the door.
NURSE: I'm sorry.
BEN: How do you know you did everything?
NURSE: I did everything.","Let's speak outside, yeah?"
The hell you get all this crap?,The Internet.,"MATT: I never learned how to sew.
FOGGY: But you learned how to fight. That news footage of you in the alley, after the bombings the way you were flipping around Your dad was a boxer. He didn't teach you any of that stuff, did he?
MATT: He didn't want me to fight. You know that.
FOGGY: So, how'd you get so good at it?",The Internet. Thought you long-underwear types stitched these together yourselves.
You're shitting me.,"He found me at the orphanage. Blind like me. Well, almost like me.","MATT: I know how it sounds.
FOGGY: I don't think that you do.
MATT: He did more than start my training. He taught me that my blindness wasn't a disability, that sight was a distraction. He helped me understand everything I could do.
FOGGY:Define ""everything.""",A blind old man taught you the ancient ways of martial arts. Isn't that the plot to Kung Fu?
"No, not okay. Can you read my mind? Can you predict the future? What? What things do you just know?","I know you haven't showered since yesterday morning. But you rinsed your face in my kitchen sink. I know you had onions in your lunch two days ago. I know you're hungry and tired. And I know the more I say, the faster your heart beats.","MATT: Helps to anticipate behavior. When someone's gonna attack, when they're lying.
FOGGY: That's how you knew Karen was telling the truth - when we first met her at the precinct.
MATT:- Yeah.
FOGGY: You listened to her heartbeat without her permission? We're lawyers! You can't do that! There's a system in place, and it's weird and invasive and - Wait. Are you telling me that since I've known you, any time I wasn't telling the truth, you knew? And what, you just played along?",You can hear a heartbeat? From across the room?
"If you weren't half dead, I would kick your ass, Murdock. Am I lying about that?",No.,"Flashback...
FOGGY: Watch out, everybody! I'm Blind Matt Murdock! Whoa!
MATT: Most - Most people just say, ""Matt Murdock.""",Was anything ever real with us?
My dad gave me a sip from this bottle of Scotch.,"Go, Dad!","Boxing match.
FOGGY:He win?
MATT: No.
FOGGY: He'd be proud of you, buddy.",He didn't want my hands shaking while I stitched him up. He got cut pretty bad over his eye.
My mom wanted me to be a butcher. I think she liked the idea of free ham.,"Hey, they coming to graduation? Your family?","MATT: Franklin Nelson for the defense, Your Honor.
FOGGY:Defense! I like that. There's money in that.
MATT: Oh, come on. Is that all you care about?
FOGGY:No No. Truth and justice and all of that.",The whole extended brood. It's not every day a Nelson breaks from the ranks of hardware and cured meats.
"Me and you, pal.We're gonna have big, fancy offices one day, with steel and glass and chairs you don't even know how to sit in. Murdock and Nelson, attorneys at law!",Nelson and Murdock. Sounds better.,"MATT: Yeah, trust me. I can't see worth shit, but my hearing's spectacular.
FOGGY: Me and you, pal - We're gonna do this. We're gonna be the best damn avocados this city has ever seen.
MATT: Best damn avocados.
FOGGY:  Let's get the hell out of here, come on. You're strong.",You think?
Front door.,You jimmied it?,"KAREN:I am. No, I I am. I was going to call you. I was out getting lunch and I thought, ""What the hell, I'll swing by the county clerk's office and see what I can find.""
BEN: You gonna ask about the box?
KAREN:Is that yours?
BEN: No, yours. Go ahead. You've earned it.","Unlocked. I keep telling you, you got to be more careful."
What the hell is this?,Everything I have on the story.,"BEN: I used to be like you back in the day. Good at turning heads, getting people's attention. Pissing them off. And that's half of it. But the other half is knowing when not to.
KAREN: I thought that we were past this. Do Do I have to convince you again just how important this is?
BEN: I know how important it is, Karen. It's just not the most important. Not to me not right now.
KAREN:Well, then where is this coming from? Did something happen?",And why are you giving it to me?
"Oh, Ben, I I'm sorry.","I made a few calls. This place, I can't put her in here. No. Gonna take some time off and bring her home.","BEN: Where?
KAREN: There's, um There's a nursing home that I just heard about upstate. Uh, I think it might change your mind.
BEN:  Karen.
KAREN:- No, just take a ride. Come on.What could it hurt? [he slightly nods] Okay.",Come take a ride with me.
"So, you want me to lie.","Mmm, you weren't particularly fond of Nobu. You thought he was unsettling, if I recall.","FISK: Wesley have the car brought around. Let Vanessa know we're on our way.
LELAND: Sir. This is getting out of hand. Ever since you started seeing that woman
FISK:Leland.  You have a son, yes?
LELAND: You know I do.",I think you're unsettling half the time. See me lighting a match?
What does that have to do with this?,Everything.,"FISK: Change is inevitable for me, this city and certain relationships.
LELAND:All right. All right, I'll go speak with her.
FISK: I appreciate your support in the matter.
LELAND: Sure, why not? We're all in this together, right? What's left of us.",Gao is right. You've changed.
"Yeah. Yeah, okay. Thanks for reaching out. [turns off] That was Brett.",What'd he say?,"MATT: It doesn't work like that. I I have to concentrate. Focus on letting it in.
FOGGY: That junkie that killed Elena - they found him.
MATT: Good.
FOGGY:Brett says he took a dive off the roof, building he was shooting up in. They had to sponge him off the sidewalk.","You couldn't hear, with your super whatever?"
Did you do that?,I told him to turn himself in.,"MATT: I didn't kill him, Foggy. It's Fisk, covering his ass.
FOGGY:  So, you've never -- You've never gone that far?
MATT; No. But I - I wanted to, after Elena after everything Fisk had done, I I went to a warehouse I thought he'd be at. I went to kill him.
FOGGY:  It's not enough playing judge and jury? You gotta add executioner to the list?",I can't hear your heartbeat. Are you telling me the truth?
You know what look.,I've been reading Thurgood Marshall.,"MATT: ""We must dissent from the indifference. We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from""
FOGGY: ""From the fear."" Yeah, I know. You've read it a million times.
MATT: You think what happened in there today was right?
FOGGY: No, Matt, I don't think it was right. But according to the law, if he did disclose trade secrets - to a third party other than his doctor","Oh, shit, not Marshall."
How the hell do you know?,'Cause I I have a feeling.,"MATT: Is this what you want to be a part of that?  Protecting corporations from people that need help?
FOGGY: It doesn't have to be like that. We get a toehold, make partner -
MATT: And then in 10, 15 years, we what? Change the system from the inside? On our way to work in our Bentleys?
FOGGY:You know how many of the other interns would kill for a real spot here? Murder us in our sleep without a second thought.","Last time I checked, those are inadmissible."
You want to say something.,Really don't.,"FOGGY: Now you're just showing off.
MATT:Say what you need to say.

Ben is driving Karen.",Your breathing changes when you're about to.
"Saying it means it's true. She has her good moments.  Lucid ones, you know? And she's sharp and strong. More than me. But she always was. She was always...","I'm sorry, Ben.","KAREN: There's nothing worse feeling choices are made for us. There's nothing you can do, but swim in shit and hope you don't get too much in your mouth.
BEN: She'd like you. Should've taken you around to meet her, but... KAREN: Yeah. You know, we all have things we hold onto for ourselves that we don't want anyone to know.
BEN: But there's always someone who does, sooner or later.
Admissions is on another tour.",Yeah.
It's not that simple and you know it.,"No, I don't know shit. Not about this. I mean, how Okay, so you get these whatever-you-call-thems when you're a kid. How do you go from that to what you're doing now?","FOGGY: You've been running around doing this since you were a kid?
MATT: No. I - I tried not to fight to make my dad proud. To - to block it out. The sirens, the pain, the fear, all strangling Hell's Kitchen. For years, I buried my head and turned away. Then one night right after we quit Landman and Zack - I heard it.
FOGGY: Heard what?
MATT: A little girl crying in her bed, in a building down the block. Her father liked to go to her room late at night when his wife was asleep.","When I was a kid, before the accident I'd lay awake at night listening to the sirens.  liked to put stories to them. Trying to figure out what they were for, ambulance or cops, robbery or fire. I don't know, just a stupid game. But after I lost my sight, after my abilities developed, I realized how many sirens there actually were how much this city suffered every single night."
It is.  How long have you been here?,A while now. Ever since my husband passed. Are you two married?,"KAREN: No, I'm single. Uh, Mrs. Vistain...
VISTAIN: Is it time?
BEN: Uh We're sorry to bother you, ma'am. We should go.
KAREN: Mrs. Vistain, um, your husband - Was that your first marriage?","[giggles] No. Well, I am, but not to her."
"Oh, um Your first marriage who was that to? VISTAIN","And, uh did you have any children with your first husband?","KAREN: Just let her answer. Mrs. Vistain?
VISTAIN:  He's such a good boy. Comes to see me every weekend. He's gentle, sweet. Not like his father.
KAREN: And what's his name? Your son?
VISTAIN: Wilson.",Karen...
"You're going to get yourself killed, you keep this up. You know that, right?",I can take care of myself.,"MATT: What do you think's gonna happen if I give up now, Foggy? Who's going to stop Fisk?
FOGGY: Oh, I don't know the law?
MATT: Tell that to Elena. If you could have put on a mask and prevented what happened to her - you telling me you wouldn't have?
FOGGY:  It's not fair, Matt.","What about the rest of us? Me, Karen we're a part of this now, because of you. And we didn't get a say in that."
"""A better place."" That kind of sounds like what Fisk keeps saying.",Don't say that. Don't twist it around.,"MATT: I made a mistake. I know that.
FOGGY: Misspelling ""Hanukkah"" is a mistake. Attempted murder is a little something else. You ever stop to think what would happen if you went to jail? Or worse? You really think that anyone would believe that I didn't know what you were doing? That Karen didn't know?
MATT: This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.
FOGGY: Maybe you're right. Maybe it does. But I don't. [tearing up] I only ever needed my friend. I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.Not from you.","You tried to kill him, Matt. You told me yourself. How is that any different than the way he solves his problems?"
"What is it, a napkin?","No, my friend, this is our future.","FOGGY:  It's a drawing of a sign. ""Nelson and Murdock, Attorneys At Law.""
MATT: You, uh You really want to do this?
FOGGY: No, I'm pissing my pants. There is actual urine in my trousers. [Matt chuckles] But I trust you. You think this is what we should be doing then I'm with you. For better or worse.
MATT:  [laughing] Sounds like we're getting married.","Huh, feels like a napkin."
"There is no one I'd rather be doing this with, buddy. Seriously.","Me, too, pal. Now raise your damn glass, 'cause I'm gonna clink the hell out of it. [raises glass] Nelson and Murdock, Attorneys at Law.","They toast. The napkin gets wet, and in a match cut it goes to the metal sign Foggy had made. He tosses it to the ground before leaving the office.Embed",Nelson and Murdock.
